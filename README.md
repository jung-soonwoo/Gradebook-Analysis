# Gradebook-Analysis

Using Python, SQL, and Pandas, I attempt to dive behind the numbers using my own personal gradebook to form conclusions.

## Background

The data being analyzed is comprised of gradebooks spanning 5 different classes over the course of 2 years. The classes were personally taught by me during my graduate degree. The class was designed for preservice undergraduate students planning to become mathematics teachers. There are ~200 students for the entire database.

## Questions Ventured

- What type of grade distribtion is observed?
- Have grades improved over time?
- Are there any observable equity dimensions/racial inequities?
- What type of correlations can be observed with final scores?

## Grade Distribution

Both of the charts show the distribution of grades over all 5 classes. In Grade Distribution #1, it can be observed that majority of students scored a B- or higher with the final score of B containing the most amount of students. In Grade Distribution #2, a histogram shows the distribution of grades over the numerical score between 0-100%. The histogram also includes the Kernal Distribution Estimate which peaks between a score of 80-90%.


## Grades VS. Time

In this box plot it can be concluded that over time, final grades of students improved every semester. This can be due to a couple of factors:
- Teacher's curriculum and quality improved over time.
- Syllabus of course changed more favorably for students.
- Students' prerequisite classes better prepared students.

## Equity Dimensions
